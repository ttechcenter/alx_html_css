This project is your chance to build a sleek and interactive website for a top-notch headphone company, using only the power of HTML and advanced CSS.

The website will showcase different sections:

About Us: Dive into the company's story and passion for sound. Products: Discover a range of headphones designed for various needs and preferences. Why Choose Us: Learn what makes these headphones stand out: award-winning sound, ultimate comfort, cutting-edge features, and built-to-last durability. Contact: Get in touch with the company - ask questions, share feedback, or connect with other audiophiles! The Challenge:

Building from Scratch: We won't rely on pre-built components like Bootstrap. You'll get to create the entire design using pure HTML and CSS.

No Javascript Allowed: This project focuses on mastering HTML and CSS, so Javascript is off limits!

Advanced Features:

Flexible Layouts: Master CSS Grid and Flexbox to design responsive and visually appealing layouts that adapt to different screen sizes. Device Friendly: Use media queries and fluid layouts so the website looks stunning on any device, from desktops to phones. Theming Made Easy: Utilize CSS custom properties (variables) for efficient theming and easier maintenance of the website's look and feel. Interactive Details: Leverage pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements to add hover effects, focus states, and other visual enhancements that improve user experience.
